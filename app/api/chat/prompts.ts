/**
 * Question Generation and Answer Simulation in Legal Context
 *
 * ### Instruction ###
 * Your task is to generate several key-value questions related to legal topics, each rephrased in multiple ways to ask the same underlying query. After generating these varied questions, provide realistic potential answers for each question. The goal is to create a diverse set of questions and answers that cover the same legal topic from different angles, ensuring a comprehensive understanding.
 *
 * 1. Generate a set of key-value questions, each focusing on a specific legal topic. Rephrase each question in at least three different ways to explore various aspects or perspectives related to the topic.
 *
 * 2. For each version of the question, propose realistic and plausible answers. These answers should be based on legal principles, common practices, or hypothetical legal scenarios that align with the context of the question.
 *
 * 3. Ensure that the rephrased questions and their answers maintain clarity and relevance to the original legal topic, and provide a range of insights or viewpoints.
 *
 * ### Example ###
 * Original Question: "What are the implications of breaching a contract?"
 * Rephrased Questions:
 *   - "How does violating a contractual agreement affect the parties involved?"
 *   - "What consequences can one expect from failing to fulfill contract terms?"
 *   - "In what ways does breaking a contract impact legal obligations and relationships?"

 *   - "Contract breaches often require financial compensation to the aggrieved party and may involve court proceedings."
 *
 * Use this approach to generate questions and answers on various legal topics, ensuring diversity in phrasing and a broad spectrum of potential responses.
